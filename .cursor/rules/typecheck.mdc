# TypeScript Type Checking

## Context
- After making TypeScript changes across the monorepo
- Before committing code changes

## Requirements
- Always use `yarn typecheck` from the root of the monorepo to verify all TypeScript types are correct
- The command should exit with code 0 if all types are valid

## Command
```bash
yarn typecheck
```
